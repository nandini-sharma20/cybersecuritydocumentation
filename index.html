    <p>Computer security, cybersecurity or information technology security (IT security) is the protection of computer systems and networks from the theft of or damage to their hardware, software, or electronic data, as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the services they provide.

The field is becoming more important due to increased reliance on computer systems, the Internet and wireless network standards such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, and due to the growth of "smart" devices, including smartphones, televisions, and the various devices that constitute the "Internet of things". Owing to its complexity, both in terms of politics and technology, cybersecurity is also one of the major challenges in the contemporary world. Also referred to as information security, cybersecurity refers to the practice of ensuring the integrity, confidentiality, and availability (ICA) of information. Cybersecurity is comprised of an evolving set of tools, risk management approaches, technologies, training, and best practices designed to protect networks, devices, programs, and data from attacks or unauthorized access.</p>

    <p>The world relies on technology more than ever before. As a result, digital data creation has surged. Today, businesses and governments store a great deal of that data on computers and transmit it across networks to other computers. Devices and their underlying systems have vulnerabilities that, when exploited, undermine the health and objectives of an organization.

A data breach can have a range of devastating consequences for any business. It can unravel a company’s reputation through the loss of consumer and partner trust. The loss of critical data, such as source files or intellectual property, can cost a company its competitive advantage. Going further, a data breach can impact corporate revenues due to non-compliance with data protection regulations. It’s estimated that, on average, a data breach costs an affected organization $3.6 million. With high-profile data breaches making media headlines, it’s essential that organizations adopt and implement a strong cybersecurity approach.</p>

    <p>When we talk about the cybersecurity market, there still persists a skill gap that will take a couple of years to fill up. In the National Cyber Security Awareness Month (NCSAM), a lot of job and salary data was explored in the cybersecurity space. And it was found that the scope of Cyber Security is buzzing with well-paying jobs that require a well-armed cyber workforce. 
      According to the predictions by experts, the scope of the Cyber Security market will become $170 billion industry by 2020. For the last 5 years, Cyber Security professionals have been making more salary than average IT professionals. And the average salary gap across the gap is 9% to state the least.

While the job size is growing, salaries are better, the skill gap is taking time to fill up. It was identified by the Center for Cyber Safety and Education Center in 2017 if job aspirants don’t start upskilling, the industry will face a deficiency of 1.8 million Cyber Security experts by 2020.

      This is a potential security threat.</p>

    <p>Network Security protects network traffic by controlling incoming and outgoing connections to prevent threats from entering or spreading on the network.</p>
<ul>
<li> Data Loss Prevention (DLP) protects data by focusing on the location, classification and monitoring of information at rest, in use and in motion.</li>

<li> Cloud Security provides protection for data used in cloud-based services and applications. </li> 

<li> Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) or Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) work to identify potentially hostile cyber activity. </li>

<li> Identity and Access Management (IAM) use authentication services to limit and track employee access to protect internal systems from malicious entities. </li>

<li> Encryption is the process of encoding data to render it unintelligible, and is often used during data transfer to prevent theft in transit. </li>

<li> Antivirus/anti-malware solutions scan computer systems for known threats. Modern solutions are even able to detect previously unknown threats based on their behavior. </li>
